\paragraph{Avoiding exponential code growth}

To realize potential danger of code size explosion, consider
CPS transformation of code
\begin{lstlisting}[style=default]
(if (adult? person)
  (if (male? person)
     (choose-beer)
     (choose-wine))
  (choose-juice))
\end{lstlisting}
with continuation
\begin{lstlisting}[style=default]
(fn [choice _]
  (case (kind choice)
    :beer (beer-jar choice)
    :wine (wine-glass choice)
    :juice (juice-bottle choice)))
\end{lstlisting}
During CPS transformation, if we substitute the code of this continuation 
for all of its calls, the code will be repeated three times in 
the CPS-transformed expression. In general, CPS code can
grow extremely large if the code of continuations is substituted
repeatedly.

To circumvent this inefficiency, CPS transformers for
expressions with multiple continuation points (\texttt{if} and
derivatives, \texttt{and}, \texttt{or}, and \texttt{case}) bind
the continuation to a fresh symbol if it is not yet a symbol.
Macro \texttt{defn-with-{\linebreak[0]}named-{\linebreak[0]}cont}
establishes the binding automatically:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=default]
=> (cps-of-if '(c t f) '(fn [x] (* 2 x)))
(let [cont (fn [x] (* 2 x))]
  (if c
      (fn [] (cont t $state))
      (fn [] (cont f $state))))
\end{lstlisting}
